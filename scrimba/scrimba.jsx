1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
React is what defines JSX

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us.

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
We need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
to tell it HOW to do each step.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger/greater than the individual pieces.









Custome components part 2



/**
Challenge: 

Part 2: 
- Add a `header` element with a nested `nav` element. Inside the `nav`,
  include a `img` element with the image of the React logo inside
  (src="./react-logo.png") and make sure to set the width to something
  more manageable so it doesn't take up the whole screen
- Add an `h1` with some text describing the page. (E.g. "Reasons
  I'm excited to learn React"). Place it above the ordered list.
- Add a `footer` after the list that says: 
    "© 20xx <last name here> development. All rights reserved."

Class - Prop.quiz



1. What do props help us accomplish?
Make a component more reusable.


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
<MyAwesomeHeader title="???" />


3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
No, because the JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will
be turned into REAL DOM elements by React. And real DOM elements
only have the properties/attributes specified in the HTML specification.
(Which doesn't include properties like `blahblahblah`)


4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar(props) {
    console.log(props.blahblahblah)
    return (
        <header>
            ...
        </header>
    )
}


5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?
An object!








// class- Passing a non-string props

import React from "react"
import Joke from "./Joke"

/*
Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that wasn't
a string datatype.

E.g. Say you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" and "downvotes"
prop that is a number, as well as a prop with an array of comments, and a boolean
of whether the joke is a pun (`isPun`).

        //string        punchline="It’s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
        //boolean        isPun={true}
        //number        upvotes={10}
                downvotes={2}
        //array        comments={[{author: "", body: "", title: ""}, {...}]}

                setup="Why don't pirates travel on mountain roads?" 
                punchline="Scurvy."

            <Joke 
                setup="What's the best thing about Switzerland?" 
                punchline="I don't know, but the flag is a big plus!"
